# Necromancy

Game created for Ludum Dare 39 (https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/necromancy) - A 48 hour solo competition where all assets (sounds, art, music, etc) and code had to be created within the time period

Compo Theme: Running out of power

"You play as a necromancer! Killing souls refills your power. In order to kill souls you must expend your power by casting magic shots using the mouse. Each soul you kill grants additional experience. With enough experience you level up, gaining a new perk point to spend that improves your magic. Along your journey, you’ll also encounter equippable items that drop on the ground, so be sure to check your inventory often with the E button. At any point in the game you can create a new dungeon by pressing the ENTER button. This will not reset your progress, and you can continue playing as the same character. If you get stuck, the ~ button will restart the game."

Controls:

W, A, S, D - Movement

ENTER - Generate new dungeon but don’t restart

E - Open Inventory/Level Menu

~ - Restart game

Mouse Click - Cast Spell

If you get stuck, don’t forget you can equip items and upgrade skills in your inventory! Does not work well on dual monitor setups, but does still run.

The game is runnable through the Executable JAR file, as well as by calling the Main method within the Game class.
